## Course Cloud Server Logon

Go to the [R for Bio Data Science Cloud Server](https://teaching.healthtech.dtu.dk/22100/rstudio.php) and follow the login procedure.

## The RStudio IDE

Upon login, you will be presented with the RStudio integrated development environment (IDE) for R:

First, just a quick change of settings to enable graphics. Click `Tools` $\rightarrow$ `Global Options`. Then under `General`, choose the tab `Graphics` and under `Graphics Device`, choose `Cairo` as your `Backend`. Then click `Apply` and finally `OK`. That was easy right? Now, please continue.

Welcome to the RStudio IDE. It allows you to consolidate all features needed to develop `R` code for analysis. Now, click `Tools` $\rightarrow$ `Global Options...` $\rightarrow$ `Pane Layout` and you will see this:

This outlines the four panes you have in your RStudio IDE and allow you rearrange them as you please. Now, re-arrange them, so that they look like this:

Click `Apply` $\rightarrow$ `OK` and you should see this:

### Source

- Where you write and edit scripts (.R files, Quarto, etc.).
- Code written here is not executed until you send it to the Console (e.g., with Ctrl+Enter / Cmd+Enter).
- Used for developing reproducible workflows instead of typing everything directly into the Console.

### Console

- Where commands are executed immediately.
- You can test quick snippets of code here.
- It shows results, error messages, and feedback from R in real time.

### Environment

- Displays the objects, variables, and data currently loaded into memory.
- Helps you keep track of what is available in your R session.
- You can clear objects or inspect them here.

### Files etc. (Files, Plots, Packages, Help, Viewer, etc.)

- A set of utility tabs:
  - Files: navigate your working directory, upload/download files.
  - Plots: displays plots generated by your code.
  - Packages: manage installed R packages.
  - Help: access R documentation.
  - Viewer/Presentation: view HTML outputs, reports, and apps.
