## Content

### The Presentation

- The format is 10-slides-in-10-mins **on the clock**
- Everyone in the group **must** be physically present and present a part of the project

- IMPORTANT: The final presentation in HTML-format must be zipped and uploaded to DTU Learn before deadline, so we can check the GitHub version is identical

### The MCQ
