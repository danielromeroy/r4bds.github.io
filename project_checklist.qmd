# Project Checklist {.unnumbered #sec-projchecklist}

**Make sure you are familiar with the rules concerning the [use of Artificial Intelligence (generative AI) in teaching and exams at DTU](#sec-air4bds)**

### IMPORTANT: Ask yourselves:

### "Have we remembered to look through the FAQ and description"
- This is essential, this is where all the information on the project is collected

### "Have we included a project README on the GitHub Repository?"
- **<span style="color: red;">IMPORTANT:</span>** First header in the README has to be "Project Contributors" and then please state the student ids and matching GitHub usernames, so we know who-is-who
- Be sure to include a direct link to your presentation, e.g. the direct link to the lecture in lab 3 is: `https://raw.githack.com/r4bds/r4bds.github.io/main/lecture_lab03.html`
- Since we're not putting data on GitHub, you need to let us know how to get the data

### “Does our presentation follow the IMRAD structure?”
- Is the presentation created as one `qmd`-file and output to a HTML?
- Are the 10 presentation slides clear and concise? (Title slides does not count)
- Did we include slide numbers in the presentation?
- Are we doing good data communication via good visualisations?
- Do we present a clear overview of the data process incl. any decisions made, e.g. using a flow chart?
- Are we clearly communicating a biological insight?
- Are we following standard guidelines? Sources, references, etc.

### “Does our project include all components of the data science cycle?”

### “Are we aware of and have included learning objectives as appropriate in the project?”

*Check your project against the course learning objectives, as defined on the DTU course base*

### “Is our project-GitHub organised as instructed and can it run end-to-end via a "doit"?”

- A "doit" is a script, which acts as a wrapper executing other scripts. In the project organisation, what would be the `00_all.qmd`-file

_(Note, this is a generic representation, e.g. you do not need exactly 3 key plots nor exactly 2 analyses)_

### “Does ALL our code in ALL our files follow the Course Style Guide?”

- Recall what we discussed in the course on styling
- See the [Course Style Guide](code_styling.qmd)
- E.g.:

### “Are we using base-R, where we should use tidyverse-R?”

- E.g. think about the following:

### “Can we explain and justify the data decisions in the project?”

- IMPORTANT: _In essence it does not matter which decision you took, what really matters is your ability to explain and justify why you took that decision, e.g. decided on a particular path in your analysis_
