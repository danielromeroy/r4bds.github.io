_Read the steps of this exercises carefully, while completing them_ 

### Assignment Feedback

_Everyone who met the deadline for handing in last week's assignment, should have gotten written feedback - **Make sure to read this**, so you get feedback on your work and progress!_

_In the unexpected case, that you met the deadline, but did not receive any feedback, please make sure to contact the teaching team_

### Introduction

Some authors are kind enough to supply the data they used for their paper, e.g.,

- "Assessment of the influence of intrinsic environmental and geographical factors on the bacterial ecology of pit latrines" [@Torondel2016]

Where the supporting data can be found here:

- [http://userweb.eng.gla.ac.uk/umer.ijaz/bioinformatics/ecological.html](http://userweb.eng.gla.ac.uk/umer.ijaz/bioinformatics/ecological.html)

### Getting Started

Again, go to the [R for Bio Data Science RStudio Cloud Server](https://teaching.healthtech.dtu.dk/22100/rstudio.php) session from last time and login and make sure you are working in the `r_for_bio_data_science` project you created previously, then:

- Create a new Quarto Document for today's exercises, e.g. lab03_exercises.qmd
- NB! The Quarto document MUST be placed together with your `.Rproj` file (defining, the project root - look in your `Files` tab) and also there, the `data`-folder should be placed!
- REMEMBER paths are important! Also, R is case-sensitive, i.e. "data" is not the same as "Data"

See [Paths and Projects](primer_paths_and_projects.qmd)

### The `here` package as your friendly neighborhood path helper

Paths can be tricky and as you have seen, some file formats *cough* .qmd's *cough*, may not really feel that strongly about your project setup, so... The `here` package to the rescue.

If you decided to put your qmd-file in e.g. an `exercises`-directory, which is a very nice and perfectly understandable idea, then you will find that the following chunk will _not_ work:

```{r}
library("tidyverse")
load(file = "data/gravier.RData") # Nope!
```

So here is the trick, `here` keeps track of your project root, as defined by the `.Rproj`-file. So the following _will_ work even if you have your `.qmd`-files in other directories:

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

library("here")
load(file = here("data/gravier.RData")) # Yup!
```

Enjoy your friendly neighborhood path helper!

### Getting the data

Add a new code chunk and add the following code (Never mind the details, we will get back to this), remember you can use headers to nicely section your quarto Document.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
base_url <- "http://userweb.eng.gla.ac.uk/umer.ijaz/bioinformatics/ecological/"
raw_data_path <- "data/_raw/"

SPE <- read_csv(file = str_c(base_url, "SPE_pitlatrine.csv"))
write_csv(x = SPE,
          file = str_c(raw_data_path, "SPE_pitlatrine.csv"))

ENV <- read_csv(file = str_c(base_url, "ENV_pitlatrine.csv"))
write_csv(x = ENV,
          file = str_c(raw_data_path, "ENV_pitlatrine.csv"))
```

Add the chunk settings `#| echo: true` and `#| eval: true`, then run the block and change the latter to `#| eval: false`.

- Discuss in your group, what this means and why we do it

<details>
<p><summary>Click here for hint</summary></p>
Where do we retrieve the data from, where do we write it to, and what happens if we run the chunk more than one time?
</details>

### Wrangling the data

- What is data wrangling?

Before we continue with plotting, we want to unify the data, so here again you will run some code, where the details are not important right now.

But... Make sure, that you have run `library("tidyverse")` somewhere in your Quarto document - Perhaps under an initial header saying "Load Libraries" or similar?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
SPE |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = -Taxa,
               names_to = "Samples",
               values_to = "OTU_Count")  |> 
  full_join(ENV, by = "Samples") |> 
  mutate(site = case_when(str_detect(Samples, "^T") ~ "Tanzania",
                          str_detect(Samples, "^V") ~ "Vietnam")) |>  
  write_tsv(file = "data/SPE_ENV.tsv")
```

Change the chunk settings as before

## Data Visualisation II

### Read the data
```{r}
#| message: false
SPE_ENV <- read_tsv(file = "data/SPE_ENV.tsv")
SPE_ENV
```

### IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS - READ!

_For these exercises, you will have to identify what you see in the plot!_

For each plot, complete the following steps

1. Look at this overview of the components of a ggplot (see below)
1. Look at the plot you are to recreate and discuss in the group:
   1. What is the data? Take a look at it and understand what is _in_ the data
   1. What are the mappings? I.e. what variables are on the x-/y-axis?
   1. Are there any colour-/fill-mappings?
   1. What are the geoms used?
   1. Are there any modifications to theme?

  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

_See if you can find something online on `geom_smooth()`_ 
</details>

       mapping = aes(x = Taxa,
                     y = Samples,
                     fill = OTU_Count)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradient2(midpoint = 10000,
                       low = "blue",
                       mid = "white",
                       high = "red") +
  theme_classic(base_size = 8) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45,
                                   hjust = 1))
```

<details>
<p><summary>Click here for hint</summary></p>
_Think about `fill` and then see if you can find something online on `geom_tile()`, `scale_fill_gradient2` and how to `ggplot rotate axis labels`_ 
</details>

#### Task 8 - Recreate the following plot

Start by running this code in a new chunk (ignore details for now)

```{r}
targets <- c("Methanobacteria", "Clostridia", "Actinobacteria",
            "Sphingobacteria", "Anaerolineae")
SPE_ENV_targets <- SPE_ENV |>
  filter(Taxa %in% targets)
```

and then use the created dataset `SPE_ENV_targets` to recreate this plot:

_Discuss in your group, which ggplot elements can you identify?_

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
ggplot(data = SPE_ENV_targets,
       mapping = aes(x = OTU_Count,
                     y = Taxa,
                     fill = Taxa)) +
  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  labs(x = "OTU Count",
       y = "Taxa Identified",
       title = "OTU Count Distribution for 5 Taxa Stratified by Site",
       caption = "Data from doi.org/10.1111/1751-7915.12334") +
  theme_minimal(base_family = "Avenir",
                base_size = 12) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(site),
             ncol = 2)
```

<details>
<p><summary>Click here for hint</summary></p>
_Here we need to use `geom_density_ridges()`, but which package contains this? Also, we are using a colour scale called `viridis`, but how do we add this? Also, perhaps there are more themes we can use than just `theme_classic()?`_ 
</details>

#### Task 9 - <span style="color: red;">GROUP ASSIGNMENT</span> (Important, see: [how to](assignments.qmd))

_For this assignment you and your group are to apply what you have learned in the two data visualisation labs. The task is to be creative and make a really nice plot using the `SPE`- and `ENV`-data sets or a relevant subset hereof, remember to include how you arrive at subsets of the data in your assignment_

Try to play around with some custom colouring. There is a nice tool to aid in choosing colours for visualisations [here](https://www.sessions.edu/color-calculator/)
